# SEPOMEX

## Important Update

We have made some significant changes to our infrastructure and technology stack. Here are the key updates:

### Cloud Provider

We are no longer using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for this repository. We have switched to Microsoft Azure as we have free credits available each month.

### Database

We have moved away from using a dedicated database instance. Instead, we are now using an internal SQLite database. This change simplifies our setup and reduces overhead.

### Artifact Registry

As this project is open source, we have decided to move away from using a private Artifact Registry. We are now using Docker Hub for storing our Docker images. This change makes our project more accessible to the community.

Please update your local environments to reflect these changes. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
